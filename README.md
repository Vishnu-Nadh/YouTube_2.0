A clone of youtube made using react js and meterial UI. The application has the functionality of searching for channels and videos, a video detail page to play video and see the suggested videos, a channel page displaying all the details and videos of the channel and a sidebar with video categories to filter videos. A free version of Youtube api is used from the rapidAPI website which is used for fetching the data.
